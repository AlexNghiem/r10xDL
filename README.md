## Thank you to my mentors

This project is a result of my internship with Raphael Gottardo's Lab at the Fred Hutch. Huge thanks to Dr. Gottardo and the team for taking me on. Specifically, Rob Amezquita took me under his wing and mentored me. Thank you Rob for being so helpful and fun! Etienne Becht and Evan Greene get honorable mention for their help and general involvement with my work. This entire field of computational biology was completely new to me, and I feel blessed to have such intelligent and patient teachers to help me navigate my various challenges. With their help, I managed to learn a great deal, and even do some sorta-cool science!

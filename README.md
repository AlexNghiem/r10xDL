Alex's Single-Cell Genomics Deep Learning Project (Summer '19)
================

Please head over to [the associated website](https://alexnghiem.github.io/r10xDL/) if you're interested in exploring:

* background information
* broad machine learning takeaways from the summer
* personal, non-scientific takeaways from the summer

Otherwise feel free to poke around! There are random drafts of papers in the 'paper drafts' folder (go figure), R code in the 'code' folder, and a bunch of tangential work in the 'other projects' folder.

## Thank you to my mentors

This work is a result of my internship with Raphael Gottardo's Lab at the Fred Hutch. Thank you to Dr. Gottardo and the team for taking me on. Specifically, Rob Amezquita took me under his wing and mentored me. Thank you Rob for being so helpful and fun! Etienne Becht and Evan Greene get honorable mention for their help and general involvement. This entire field of computational biology was completely new to me, and I feel blessed to have such intelligent and patient teachers to help me navigate my various challenges. With their help, I managed to learn a great deal, and even do some sorta-cool science!
